## About Licensing
Certify The Web *Certify Certificate Manager* is a commercial product. A free community edition is available for download and evaluation (limited to a few managed certificates). 


:::note

 *This documentation covers the Certify (SSL/TLS) Certificate Manager app. We also have seperate licensing for our [Certify DNS](../dns/providers/certifydns.md) managed dns challenge service which is **not** covered by the licensing below.*

:::

You can purchase a license key which will then enable you to install the app on one or machines (depending on your license type). You can purchase multiple license keys to fit different sized installs and each install can manage an unlimited number of certificates through your choice of Certificate Authority.

You can review and manage your license keys and active installs via your certifytheweb.com profile under License Keys. 

There are two main methods of licensing:
- License Bundles
- Cloud Managed Licenses

*We do not offer special licensing terms for any type of organisation.*

## License Bundles
For the Certify The Web app you can currently purchase the following license bundles:

| Type          | Renewal Frequency | Number of Installs| Price         | Bundle Saving |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|--|
| Starter       | 12 Months         | 1                 | $59 USD    | n/a|
| Professional  | 12 Months         | 3                 | $149 USD    | 15%|
| Power Pro     | 12 Months         | 25                | $899 USD   | 39%|
| Enterprise    | 12 Months         | 100               | $5900 USD   | 57%|

From 1st November 2023 we have moved to a 12 month renewal cycle for all license tiers and revised pricing, this will apply to new licenses, **existing renewals will remain on the previous pricing/terms until after 1st Nov 2025**. Pricing for Power Pro and Enterprise tiers last revised 1st February 2024.

These give you 1 license key (per bundle purchased) which can be used up to the given number of installs.

License tier names are an arbitrary label and are not related to the size/nature of your organisation, they are just our name for the license bundle.

These license bundles can be purchased using a credit card (via Stripe) or via PayPal. 

**Proforma Invoicing, reseller accounts etc are not supported due to the manual processing involved. See Cloud Licensing instead or you can also get a link to send to someone else to complete payment on behalf of your account.**

Notifications are sent when your license key is about to expire. To stop receiving notifications about an expiring or expired license key, sign into your certifytheweb.com profile and choose `Cancel Now` from the License keys tab.

## Cloud Managed Licenses
An alternative to purchasing a license bundle is to have a flexible license that's managed via a cloud subscription. 

The benefits of a cloud managed license are:
- **Billing is entirely integrated into your organisations existing cloud provider subscription.**
- You have one product license key which you can apply to multiple installs.
- You can increase or decrease the number of installs required at any time. 
- Your organisation is only billed (by the cloud provider) for the number of installs you have set in your cloud subscription (pro rata per month).

Cloud subscription pricing varies by provider. The *number of licensed installs* set on your subscription is referred to by cloud providers as *Seats* or *Users*.

:::note

Note: If you license (for example) 10 installs but only actually install 9 you will be billed for 10. You can review your currently activated installs on your certifytheweb.com profile under License Keys. You cannot have a greater number of active installs than licensed installs.

:::

We currently use Microsoft Azure marketplace for our subscriptions. *This is only a convenient billing mechanism and does not require you to have servers hosted with Azure.*

To get started with cloud managed licensing via Microsoft Azure billing you can use any of the following links to create your subscription: 

- [Microsoft Azure SaaS Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/webprofusionptyltd1588924351007.certifytheweb-standard-cloudlicense?tab=Overview)
- [Microsoft App Source](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/webprofusionptyltd1588924351007.certifytheweb-standard-cloudlicense)
- [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#create/webprofusionptyltd1588924351007.certifytheweb-standard-cloudlicense/preview)

Cloud Managed License pricing via Azure is **$4.99 USD per install per month**.

If you would like us to support a different cloud provider marketplace for licensing, please contact `support at certifytheweb.com`.

## Upgrading and Downgrading License Keys
If you are using a license bundle, you can downgrade your license bundle through the License Keys tab of your certifytheweb.com account when your license is about to expire (or has already expired). 
If you currently have a license key and want to renew your license at a lower tier, you can choose the `Downgrade Now` option. 

To upgrade to a new license tier you can either purchase a new license key of the required type and move each install to the new key (About > Deactivate Install, then About > Enter Key..) or alternatively contact `support at certifytheweb.com` to discuss upgrade options for an existing license key.
