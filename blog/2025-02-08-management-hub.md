## What is Certify Management Hub?

*Certify Management Hub* offers a unified view of all your managed certificates across your organizationâ€”or even across multiple organizations. Key capabilities include:
- Optional centralized certificate renewal or delegation of renewals to individual *Certify Certificate Manager* instances and compatible agents.
- All the standard [features](https://certifytheweb.com/home/features) of *Certify Certificate Manager* for ACME certificate renewals and deployment tasks.
- Integration with existing *Certify Certificate Manager* installations, enabling users to manage certificates across hundreds of servers while maintaining local renewal processes.

## Key Features

### Centralized Management
Manage all your certificates in one place, eliminating the need to log into multiple systems. While certificates can be centrally managed, you can also retain control over renewals on individual servers, particularly for HTTP domain-validated certificates. The hub serves as a reporting and administration tool for added convenience.

### Automated Renewals
Say goodbye to expired certificates. The Management Hub automates its own renewals and provides visibility into the renewal process across multiple *Certify Certificate Manager* instances, ensuring your certificates remain valid and up-to-date.

### Detailed Reporting
Access comprehensive reports on certificate status, including upcoming expirations and renewal logs. This helps you stay informed and avoid potential issues.

### Managed (DNS) Challenges
Optionally centralize DNS challenge configurations and allow compatible ACME clients to use the Management Hub API for DNS validation updates. This eliminates the need to distribute sensitive DNS API credentials across multiple servers.

## Installation Options
*Certify Management Hub* is self-hosted and can be installed on Windows Server, Linux, macOS, or container environments such as Docker, Kubernetes, and IBM/RedHat OpenShift.

## Simple Upgrade for Certify Certificate Manager Users

Upgrading to *Certify Management Hub* is straightforward for existing *Certify Certificate Manager* users. Update your app to version 7 or later, then configure the app with the Management Hub URL and joining key.

## Join the Beta
