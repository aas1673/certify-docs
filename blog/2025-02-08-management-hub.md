## What is Certify Management Hub?

Certify Management Hub provides a single view of all of your managed certificates across your organizations. You can optionally centrally renew certificates or delegate certificate renewals to individual Certify Certificate Manager (and compatible agents). Existing Certify Certificate Manager users can use the management hub to see and manage certificates across hundreds of servers.

## Key Features

### Centralized Management
With the Certify Management Hub, you can view and manage all your certificates in one place. This eliminates the need to log into multiple systems and simplifies the management process.

### Automated Renewals
Never worry about expired certificates again. The Management Hub automates the renewal process, ensuring that your certificates are always valid and up-to-date.

### Detailed Reporting
Get detailed reports on the status of your certificates, including upcoming expirations and renewal logs. This helps you stay on top of your certificate management and avoid any potential issues.

### Managed (DNS) Challenges
Optionally centralize the configuration of DNS challenges and let compatible ACME clients use the management hub API to request DNS validation updates on their behalf. This removes the need to distribute sensitive DNS API credentials over many servers.
