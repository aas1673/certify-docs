            <description><![CDATA[Simplify and streamline your SSL/TLS certificate management with Certify Management Hub.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are thrilled to announce <strong>Certify Management Hub</strong>, our upcoming tool designed to simplify and streamline SSL/TLS certificate management. This centralized UI and API solution allows you to manage all your certificates from a single interface, making centralized renewal optional. Whether you're managing certificates for a small business or a large enterprise, the Management Hub provides the tools you need to keep your certificates up-to-date and secure.</p>
<p>If you'd like to explore the alpha version, we are preparing new <a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/docs/hub/">documentation for Certify Management Hub</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://certifytheweb.com/images/management/summary.png" alt="Certify Management Hub" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The first alpha version will be released at the end of March 2025. Beta phases will follow, incorporating user feedback, with the first stable release expected later in the year.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-certify-management-hub">What is Certify Management Hub?<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/introducing-management-hub#what-is-certify-management-hub" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Certify Management Hub?" title="Direct link to What is Certify Management Hub?">​</a></h2>
<p><em>Certify Management Hub</em> offers a unified view of all your managed certificates across your organization—or even across multiple organizations. Key capabilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optional centralized certificate renewal or delegation of renewals to individual <em>Certify Certificate Manager</em> instances and compatible agents.</li>
<li>All the standard <a href="https://certifytheweb.com/home/features" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">features</a> of <em>Certify Certificate Manager</em> for ACME certificate renewals and deployment tasks.</li>
<li>Integration with existing <em>Certify Certificate Manager</em> installations, enabling users to manage certificates across hundreds of servers while maintaining local renewal processes.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[ACME profiles draft implementation]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have implement support for the ACME Profiles extension, a new feature designed to enhance the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol. This extension allows ACME Servers to offer a selection of different certificate profiles to ACME Clients, making it easier for clients to request the specific type of certificate they need.</p>
<p>ACME Profiles are a new proposed extension to the ACME standard allows CAs to offer certificates with different features depending on user preferences.</p>
<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aaron-acme-profiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aaron-acme-profiles/</a></p>
<p>This feature will be available in the next major release of Certify Certificate Manager and Certify Management Hub.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-acme-profiles">What are ACME Profiles?<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/acme-profiles-draft#what-are-acme-profiles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are ACME Profiles?" title="Direct link to What are ACME Profiles?">​</a></h2>
<p>ACME Profiles provide a way for Certificate Authorities (CAs) to advertise the different types of certificates they can issue. For example, a CA might offer a certificate with a shorter lifetime and different key usage constraints. By selecting a profile, clients can ensure they receive a certificate that meets their specific requirements.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="key-features">Key Features<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/acme-profiles-draft#key-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key Features" title="Direct link to Key Features">​</a></h2>

<p>ACME Profiles make it easier for CAs to introduce new and improved certificate types. Clients can quickly adopt these new profiles without needing to change their existing workflows or configurations.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="enhanced-security">Enhanced Security<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/acme-profiles-draft#enhanced-security" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enhanced Security" title="Direct link to Enhanced Security">​</a></h3>
<p>By moving profile selection out of the CSR and into the ACME protocol, ACME Profiles reduce the risk of compliance incidents caused by incorrect or malicious CSR values. This helps ensure that certificates are issued according to the CA's policies and standards.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-it-works">How It Works<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/acme-profiles-draft#how-it-works" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How It Works" title="Direct link to How It Works">​</a></h2>

<p>ACME Servers that support profiles will include a new <code>profiles</code> field in their Directory object. This field lists the available profiles and provides human-readable descriptions or URLs to documentation.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="client-requests">Client Requests<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/acme-profiles-draft#client-requests" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Client Requests" title="Direct link to Client Requests">​</a></h3>
<p>When creating a new Order, clients can specify the desired profile in the <code>profile</code> field of the Order object. The server will then issue a certificate that matches the selected profile.</p>
<p>In <strong>Certify Certificate Manager</strong> and <strong>Certify Management Hub</strong> this will be available as an option under under <em>Certificate &gt; Advanced &gt; Certificate Authority</em>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="current-implementations">Current Implementations<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/acme-profiles-draft#current-implementations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Current Implementations" title="Direct link to Current Implementations">​</a></h2>
<p>Let's Encrypt's Boulder ACME Server software fully implements the ACME Profiles extension. Although profiles are not yet configured in Let's Encrypt's Production and Staging environments, the Pebble ACME Server testbed also supports this extension.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/acme-profiles-draft#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>The ACME Profiles extension is a significant step forward in providing flexibility and preferences in automated certificate management. By allowing clients to select predefined profiles, it reduces complexity, enhances security, and provides greater flexibility for both clients and CAs.</p>
<p>We encourage you to explore the ACME Profiles feature when it becomes available and provide feedback to help us continue improving this important protocol.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Posh-ACME is ideal for PowerShell enthusiasts who need a highly scriptable solution, win-acme is great for users who prefer the command line, while Certbot is a robust and widely known option (on Linux).</p>
<p>Ultimately, the best ACME client for you will depend on your specific needs and environment. We encourage you to explore these options and choose the one that best fits your requirements.</p>]]></content:encoded>
